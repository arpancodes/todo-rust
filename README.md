# TODO App

What's the better way to start learning a new programming language than building a todo app?

This app is a simple todo list app. It is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Utilises some of the core features of rust such as: structs, enums, traits, file I/O, command line arguments, and the [`serde`](https://serde.rs/) library.
